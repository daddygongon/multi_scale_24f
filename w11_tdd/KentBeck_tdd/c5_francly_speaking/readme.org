* sin thing
What short step will get us to a green bar?
Copying the Dollar code and replacing Dollar with Franc.

Stop. Hold on. I can hear the aesthetically inclined
among you sneering and spitting.
Copy-and-paste reuse?

Remember, cut cyclce has different phases
(the go by quickly, ogten in seconds,
but they are phases.):
